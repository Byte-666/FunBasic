FunBasic - Functional Basic

Let's create another basic dialect, this time let's turn Basic into an real FP language with all the goodies. Visual Basic from Microsoft is too enterprisey and boring and also very, very verbose, at least as verbose as Java because of the longer keywords. 
A Basic language must be basic, it should be simple, with only the minimum needed, basic as black, as they say. Incidentally I only wear black clothes without stamps or anything fancy. That's basic. Basic it's not only for beginners (pascal is, they don't have poke). 

Basic principles of FP:
. Immutability
. First-order functions
. Function composition
